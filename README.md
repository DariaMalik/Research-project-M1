# Research-project-M1
Some results from our team project on the image processing for the seismological lab tests.

The aim was to write an algorithm which could detect the points of interest on images and extract their coordinates for the following studies. You'll find our project report and code in the repository. The link to the ZIP with images (.mat) is below :
